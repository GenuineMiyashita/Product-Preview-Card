## My process

I started with semantic HTML5 markup and ensuring that it passed through W3C's HTML validator. Afterwards, I used a mobile-first approach by using FireFox's developer tools for the responsive mode and using a iPhone 12/13 pro as my screen sample. With the CSS, I worked from the top-down approach and passed it through W3C's CSS validator too.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My biggest take-away was handling the media queries and figuring out how to prevent the information from breaking inbetween breakpoints, primarly the text area. I learned that using min-width (aside from the media query) was the solution.

### Continued development

I want to continue development on HTML and CSS, but primarily responsive design and flexbox. I'm aiming to start incorporating Bootstrap and others in future projects.
